# Exploring Yug Forge Features: Understanding Shaders

Welcome to the world of Yug Forge, where creativity knows no bounds and every design is a work of art. In this blog post, we embark on a journey into the enchanting realm of shaders, those magical elements that elevate 3D graphics to a whole new level.

## Unveiling the Essence of Shaders

Shaders are the painters of the 3D world. They determine the colors, textures, and visual effects that grace every surface, adding depth and life to the models we create. In Yug Forge, shaders are the enchanting spells that weave the magic into your 3D graphics.

### What Shaders Truly Are

Shaders are specialized programs that run on the GPU, dictating how each pixel of a 3D model should be rendered. There are mainly two types of shaders:

- **Vertex Shaders:** These shape the geometry of the model, deciding its structure and placement.
  
- **Fragment Shaders:** These deal with the pixels, defining their colors and shades.

## Yug Forge: A Playground of Shaders
